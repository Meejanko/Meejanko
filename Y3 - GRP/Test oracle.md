# Test Oracle

In computing, software engineering, and software testing, a test oracle (or just oracle) is a mechanism for determining whether a test has passed or failed. The use of oracles involves comparing the output(s) of the system under test, for a given test-case input, to the output(s) that the oracle determines that product should have. The term "test oracle" was first introduced in a paper by William E. Howden. Additional work on different kinds of oracles was explored by Elaine Weyuker.

Oracles often operate separately from the system under test. However, method postconditions are part of the system under test, as automated oracles in design by contract models. Determining the correct output for a given input (and a set of program or system states) is known as the oracle problem or test oracle problem, which is a much harder problem than it seems, and involves working with problems related to controllability and observability.  

测试准则，是软件测试员或软件工程师用来检测测试是否通过的一种机制。测试准则决定在给定的测试用例输入下产品应有的输出，从而与被测试系统的输出做比较。这一术语在威廉·豪登（William Howden）的《测试理论入门》一书中首次被使用和定义。艾琳·韦约克又对不同类型的测试准则给予了拓展。测试准则经常独立于被测试系统。在自动化测试中后置条件方法是通常被使用的自动化了的测试准则。测试准则问题往往比看起来要难得多，同时会连带要求解决可控性和可观测性问题。
