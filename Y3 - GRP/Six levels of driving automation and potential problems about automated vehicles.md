# Six levels of driving automation

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) currently defines 6 levels of driving automation ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous). These levels have been adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation.

**0 NO Automation**

Manual control The human performs all driving tasks (steering, acceleration, braking, etc.).

**1 Driver Assistance**

The vehicle features a single automated system (e.g. it monitors speed through cruise control).

**2 Partial Automation**
ADAS The vehicle can perform steering and acceleration. The human still monitors all tasks and can take control at any time.

**3 Conditional Automation**
Environmental detection capabilities. The vehicle can perform most driving tasks, but human override is still required.

**4 High Automation**
The vehicle performs all driving tasks under specific circumstances. Geofencing is required. Human override is still an option.

**5 Full Automation**
The vehicle performs all driving tasks under all conditions. Zero human attention or interaction is required.


# Some potential problems that autonomous vehicles will face

**Artificial vs. Emotional Intelligence**

Human drivers rely on subtle cues and non-verbal communication—like making eye contact with pedestrians or reading the facial expressions and body language of other drivers—to make split-second judgment calls and predict behaviors. Will autonomous cars be able to replicate this connection? Will they have the same life-saving instincts as human drivers?

**Weather Conditions**

What happens when an autonomous car drives in heavy precipitation? If there’s a layer of snow on the road, lane dividers disappear. How will the cameras and sensors track lane markings if the markings are obscured by water, oil, ice, or debris?

**Traffic Conditions and Laws**

Will autonomous cars have trouble in tunnels or on bridges? How will they do in bumper-to-bumper traffic? Will autonomous cars be relegated to a specific lane? Will they be granted carpool lane access? And what about the fleet of legacy cars still sharing the roadways for the next 20 or 30 years?
